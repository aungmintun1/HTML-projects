              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

<!-- 
when making the site go live, it might be better to put the js file in a different folder than node node_modules
because when it is live you normally don't want the node_modules folder included to go in the server.
perhaps make a distribution folder and put the js file in there bootstrap.bundle.min.js
